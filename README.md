# MQ-2 Smoke & Gas Detection System
Arduino-Based Environmental Safety Alert System

This project detects smoke or harmful gas concentration using an MQ-2 gas sensor and activates a buzzer and LED alarm when the value exceeds a predefined danger threshold.
It is useful for home safety, industrial environments, kitchen safety, and fire detection systems.

# Hardware Components

1. Arduino UNO / Nano

2. MQ-2 Gas & Smoke Sensor

3. Buzzer

4. LED

5. Jumper wires

6. USB cable

7. Working Principle

The MQ-2 sensor outputs an analog value, representing the concentration of smoke or gas (LPG, methane, propane, hydrogen, alcohol, CO).
The system continuously reads this value using the Arduino’s analog input.
If the value is higher than the safety threshold, the system triggers an alarm using a buzzer and LED.

# Applications

1. Fire and smoke detection systems

2. Home kitchen gas leak safety systems

3. Industrial air-quality monitoring

4. LPG / methane leakage alarm

5. Smart home IoT system integration
